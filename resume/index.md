## Work Experience

### Senior Software Engineer - Google - Mountain View, CA

**08/2012 - Present**

Over a decade's experience working on web standards and browser implementation on the Chrome GPU team. Served as an editor for the [WebGPU specification](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/), co-created and served as an editor for the [WebXR specification](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/), and participated heavily in the development of the [WebGL](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/) and [WebGL 2](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/) specifications, in addition to contributing to the implementation of all of the above in the Google Chrome browser.

### Lead Software Engineer - Motorola Mobility - Sunnyvale, CA

**05/2011 - 08/2012**

Developed HTML 5 applications with and assisted in the development of the [MontageJS HTML5 framework](https://montagejs.org/). Led a team of 2-5 developers on multiple projects for internal and external clients. Work includes the Google Chrome "Scratchpad" application and the "Tips and Tricks" application shown on first boot of all Chrome OS devices.

### Software Engineer - FATPOT Technologies - Bountiful, UT

**11/2005 - 05/2011**

Responsible for developing and actively maintaining multiple software products for the public safety industry. Examples of such products are: Two field reporting applications, Web-based management tools, in-house developer utilities, server-side applications and scripts, GPS vehicle plotting with multiple online mapping applications (such as Google Maps), and data submission to third party systems.

### Technician, Web Developer - PS Web Solutions - Salt Lake City, UT

**3/2004 - 10/2005**

Charged with development and maintenance of multiple web pages, most of which were created with PHP and SQL, as well as building and maintaining six large web-based databases. In addition, I was responsible for repairing and integrating software developed by a third party, outsourced company which had failed to complete the project given them. I was responsible for maintenance of server hardware (Windows Server 2003 and Gentoo) and of the in-office computers and network. Servers used Apache HTTP server and IIS.

## Community Contributions

I am a strong believer in open source software, giving back to the community, and helping other developers acheive their goals. As such I make almost every piece of software I write available either as open source libraries or example applications for others to use or reference. Prominent examples include:

 - **[Toji.dev](https://toji.dev)**

    My personal page where I have published multiple articles about effective use of WebGPU and WebXR. For example, a article on [effective optimization patterns to use when rendering with WebGPU](https://toji.dev/webgpu-gltf-case-study/) explained through use of the glTF model format, with live examples.

 - **[glMatrix](https://glmatrix.net)**

    I developed and maintain one of the most popular JavaScript matrix and vector math libraries. Aimed at high performance for realtime 3D applications, it is highly optimized and designed to allow minimal garbage creation.

 - **[WebXR samples](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/)**

    I developed the original suite of sample pages to demonstrate use of the WebXR API and it's various extended features. This list of samples has become a frequently used reference for developers that are learning the API as well as a defacto test suite for new API implementations.

 - **[XR Dinosaurs](https://xrdinosaurs.com)**

    A fun WebXR page I developed both to help test and improve the API's integration with Three.js and make my kids smile. Frequently promoted by Meta in the Quest browser.

 - **[My Github profile](https://github.com/toji)**

    Lists many additional smaller projects.

 - **Guest lectures at University of Pennsylvania**

    I have given many technical presentations over the years, but some of my favorite have been the guest lecures I was invited to give in [2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm2_bH_8j3k) and [2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41pC1MLMVdA) for the University of Pennsylvania CIS 565 program.

## Fun facts

 - **glTF Model format proposal**

    While at Motorola I collaborated with Fabrice Robinet to design the initial iterations of what would eventually become the [glTF model format](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html), which has become an industry standard for exchange of realtime rendered 3D assets. You can see [a video of Fabrice and I presenting the concept](https://youtu.be/l40d2yEG-VU?si=SOg7t7RglsBL4-DR&t=1584) (then called COLLADA2JSON) at SIGGRAPH 2012 during the Khronos BOF session.

    It should be noted that while many elements of the model format were initially proposed by me I only participated loosely in the standardization process due to other obligations at the time. This is why [I am listed in the "Special Thanks" section of the spec](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#special-thanks).

  - **[WebGPU logo](https://github.com/gpuweb/admin/issues/14#issuecomment-801444493)**

    I designed and proposed the logo that was eventually accepted by the WebGPU working group.
