# Hi!

I'm Brandon Jones, frequently known by the username "toji" or "tojiro" on various parts of the web, and this is my "About Me" page. I also host some of my tech writing about WebGPU and WebXR here.

## My Work
I have been at Google on the Chrome team for 10+ years working on various Web APIs, including:

 - [WebGL 1.0](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/)
 - [WebGL 2.0](https://registry.khronos.org/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/)
 - [Gamepad](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/), briefly as a spec editor.
 - [WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/), as one of the originial API creators and a spec editor.
 - [WebGPU](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/), as a spec editor.

If you need to contact me for work reasons, the best way is my corporate email: bajones@google.com

## My Code
Almost everything I work on is open source, with the majority of it being either on the Chromium project and its dependencies or [GitHub](https://github.com/toji). Outside of Chrome I tend to work on either utility libraries or samples for the various bits of web tech I'm working on. Some of my more notable projects include:

 - [glMatrix](https://glmatrix.net/) - High performance JavaScript vector and matrix library.
 - [Quake 3 WebGL Map Viewer](https://media.tojicode.com/q3bsp/) - On of the more complex early WebGL projects on the web.
 - [WebXR Samples](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/) - Samples written to demonstrate the WebXR API.
 - [XR Dinosaurs](https://www.xrdinosaurs.com/) - Cute WebXR dinosaur experience.
 - [Spookyball](https://spookyball.com/) - Halloween-themed breakout clone. One of the first WebGPU games.
 - [Efficiently rendering glTF with WebGPU](https://toji.github.io/webgpu-gltf-case-study/) - Article covering problems you may encounter when loading models with WebGPU and how to fix them.
