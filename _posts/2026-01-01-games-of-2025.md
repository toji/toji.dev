title: My games of 2025

Last year I did [a recap of all the games I played during 2024](https://mastodon.social/@tojiro/113744606844506807), and I kinda want to make that an annual thing. So here's
my quick rundown of everything I played in 2025. Note that the list is more-or-less in the order that I played them, and
I'm including almost everything I played, so none of that top 10 business here.

## [Caravan Sand Witch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/)
Reccommended by a friend. Really chill, story-driven experience. Zero combat. Ending was pretty sudden, which was a
let-down. Also, there's a big character reveal that falls flat because you're like "Wait, am I supposed to know who
this is?" Still nice to just explore, though. **6/10**

## [Star of Providence](https://store.steampowered.com/app/603960/Star_of_Providence)
Amusing little rouge-like that I toyed with on and off throughout the year. Never held my attention for too long, but I
still enjoyed the time that I spent with it. **7/10**

## [Blue Prince](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince)
Really REALLY enjoyed this one. Took a bit to "get it" but after that I sunk a lot of time into this one. Unfortunately
never got to the true ending it because at some point you start solving puzzles who's reward is just clues to other
puzzles you've already solved, while some of the biggest puzzles remain too opaque to move forward on. Still, highly
recommended! **9/10**

## [Undertale](https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/)
Finally got around to playing this one all the way through. Tried for a fully peaceful run first go, only to find out
that that's pretty much forbidden by the last boss. It was.... fine? I liked it, but I'm not sure I really get the
intense fandom. (Megalovania slaps, though! Too bad my run skipped it entirely.) **6/10**

## [Doom the Dark Ages](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages)
I really enjoyed Doom 2016, still had fun with but felt less enthusiastic about Doom Eternal. This felt like a very
comfortable middle ground for me, and I had a blast with it. I could have done without so many Very Serious Cutscenes,
though. Doom's storytelling for me peaked in the first 10 minutes of Doom 2016 when the player smashes an intercom to
get the lore dump to shut up, and they've never really recaptured that. **9/10**

## [Spider-Man 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2)
I really enjoyed Spider-Man and Miles Morales, so was hoping for more of the same here and it mostly is, but the story
didn't click for me as well and the state that the game leaves you in after 100%ing it (monster attacks still randomly
spawning all over the city) left a bad taste in my mouth. Still, hard to complain about how fun it is to just swing and
glide around the city. **8/10**

## [Unravel 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1225570/Unravel_Two)
I had started playing this one with my son a couple of years back but he wasn't quite ready for it. Gave it another shot
this year and we made it all the way through! Sequences where you're being chased by some sort of critter are the best.
Ends pretty abruptly. Still a fun co-op experience. **7/10**

## [Viewfinder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382070/Viewfinder)
Interesting, reminded me a lot of Superliminal in that it clearly wants to be Portal and brushes up against it, but in
the end just doesn't quite have the same kind of hook. **7/10**

## [Silksong](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong)
I know this isn't a ranked list, but this is far and away my game of the year. Beautiful, fun, and brutally difficult,
I sunk more time into this than I care to admit, and am ravenously awaiting the DLC. Everything I had hoped for from a
Hollow Knight sequel and more! **11/10**

## [Hades 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II)
Technically a game I started in 2024, but I came back after they hit 1.0 to finish the story mode. The story wraps up
nicely! But I also have some issues with how that story resolution is squared with the game loop, which isn't handled
here nearly as nicely as in Hades 1. Still, it's a fantastic game! **10/10**

## [Lego Voyagers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538550/LEGO_Voyagers/)
Another co-op game with my son. Controls took a bit of getting used to. We had fun with it for a while but he eventually
lost interest. I enjoyed the abstract Lego-ness of it all.  **8/10**

## [Ball x Pit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2062430/BALL_x_PIT/)
A fun take on the Vampire Survivors formula which I've only started playing. Wish that harvesting wasn't such a pain,
but the main gameplay is fun! **8/10**
