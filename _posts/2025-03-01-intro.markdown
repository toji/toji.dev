Hey all! I've added a blog section to the site to supplement the articles that I typically post on here.

My general intent is to use blog posts to talk about things that are more transient or time sensitive than my typical
article content, which should be applicable for a long time. Also, I may use it to just talk about non-development
topics from time to time!
